# Organic Chemistry
- Homologous series, the families in which we classify organic compounds
  - They have the same functional groups (a group of atoms found within a molecule that are involved in the chemical reactions characteristics of those molecules)
  - They have the same general formula
  - They have similar chemical property but slightly varying physical properties
  - Members differ by a CH<sub>2<sub> group
- A list of some homologous series
  - Alkanes, single bond from C-C
  - Alkenes, double bond from C-C
  - Alkynes
  - Alchohol, OH bond at the end
  - carbocylic acid, COOH (caboxyl)
  - Esters, ester linkage COO group
  - aldehyde, -CHO
  - ketones, - CO 

# Terms
- **Hydrocarbon:** a compound containing only carbon and hydrogen.
- **Empirical formula:** the simplest whole number ratio of the elements present in a compound.
- **Molecular formula:** the total number of atoms of each element present in a molecule of the compound. A molecular formula is an integer multiple of the empirical formula.
- **Structural formula:** Also called a displayed or graphic formula, shows all the atoms and bonds in a molecule
- **Condensed structural formula:** The simplest representation that shows how the atoms are joined together in a molecule.

# Homologous series
- A series of compounds with the same functional group
- Each member differ by CH<sub>2<sub>
- members of the series have similar chemical properties
- members of the series have slightly different physical properties such as boiling point increasing as the chain becomes longer 
  - their boiling point increase as there is more electrons hence more london forces


# Alkanes
- **General Formula:** C<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2n+2</sub>
- Saturated bonds
- **Reactions:**
  - Combustion:
    - Alkanes combust with oxygen usually produces carbon dioxide and water
    - Alkanes are a good fuel source as they are exothermic
    - The enthalpy change are negative as the reaction is exothermic
    - THe enthalpy change decreases with more carbon as more carbon dioxide and water molecules are produces as the length of the carbon chain increases
    - Two types of combustion
      - Complete combustion (excess of oxygen)
        - C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>8</sub> (g) + 5O<sub>2</sub> -> **3CO<sub>2</sub> (g)** + 4H<sub>2</sub>O (g)
      - Incomplete combustion (lack of oxygen) 
        - C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>8</sub> (g) + 3½O<sub>2</sub> -> **3CO (g)** + 4H<sub>2</sub>O (g)
        - C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>8</sub> (g) + 2O<sub>2</sub> -> **3C (g)** + 4H<sub>2</sub>O (g)
  - Free radical subsitution
    - Alkanes are relatively unreactive
      - The C-H bond are non polar bonds (electronegativity difference is 0.4)
      - The C-C and C-H bonds are relatively strong
    - **Free radicals:** species with unpaired electrons which are represented by a dot (•)
      - They are very reactive due to the unpaired electron
    - Free radical subsitution
      - Initiation - occurs in the presence of UV light
        - Cl<sub>2</sub> -> 2Cl•
        - **Photochemical homolytic fission:** the bond is broken and each atom takes 1 electron
      - Propagation - reactions which keep the chain of reaction going
        - CH<sub>4</sub> + Cl• -> •CH<sub>3</sub> + HCL
        - •CH<sub>3</sub> + Cl<sub>2</sub> -> CH<sub>3</sub>Cl + Cl•
      - Termination - reactions which removes the free radical from the system
        - Cl• + Cl• -> Cl<sub>2</sub>
        - •CH<sub>3</sub> + •CH<sub>3</sub> -> C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>
        - •CH<sub>3</sub> + Cl• -> CH<sub>3</sub>Cl

# Isomerism
- Structural isomerism
  - positional isomerism, changing the position of a bond or atom or a branch
  - functional group isomerism, changing the functional group 
  - chain isomerism, changing how the chain is structured
