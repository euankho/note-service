Oscillations

- Most common type of oscillation is isochronous (taking the same time)
- equilibrium position is when the displacement (in the x-axis) is 0 
- time period / period (T) is measured in seconds and is the duration of a cycle
- Amplitude is the maximum value of the displacement 
- Frequency (f) is the number of oscillations per unit time

$$T = \frac{1}{f}$$

# Waves
- There are two types
    - mechanical waves, which require a material medium through which to travel
    - electromagnetic waves, waves which travel through a vacuum
- A wave is initiated by a vibrating object (the source) and it travels away from the object.
- The particles of the medium vibrate about their rest position at the same frequency as the source.
- The wave transfers energy from one place to another.

- longitudinal wave: waves in which the displacement of the medium is in the same direction as, or the opposite direction to, the direction of propagation of the wave
- transverse wave: a wave that vibrates perpendicular to the direction of the wave or path of propagation

## Describing Waves
- Wavelength: $$\lambda$$ is the shortest distance between 2 points on a wave (in different oscillation)
- Frequency: $$f$$ the number of vibrations per second 
- Period: $$T$$ the time it takes to undergo one compelte oscillation
- Amplitude: $$A$$ the maximum displacement of the wave from its rest position

## Wave speed eqution
$$c = f\lambda$$

# Electromagnetic waves
- All electromagnetic waves (except gamma rays) are produced when electrons undergo
an energy change
- Gamma rays are different, they are emitted by a
nucleus or by means of other particle decays or annihilation events.

# Wave characteristics

- **Wave front:** a surface that travels with the wave and is perpendicular to the direction of the wave 

- **Ray:**  a line showing the direction in which a wave transfers energy, or direction of propagation of a wave and is also  perpendicular to a wavefront.

- The distance between two consecutive wavefronts is one wavelength (λ).

## Intensity of waves

- The energy E is found to be proportional to the square of the
  amplitude A:
  $$E ∝ A^2$$

- loudness and brightness are each affected by
  frequency

  - $$I = \frac{P}{4\pi r^2}$$

  - SI Unit for Intensity is $$W m^-2$$

## Principle of superposition

- when two or more waves meet the total displacement is the vector sum of their individual displacements

  - Green wave shows the vector sum of blue and red waves

## Polarization

- Polarization of
a transverse wave restricts the direction of oscillation to a plane
perpendicular to the direction of propagation
- When the direction of vibration stays constant over time, the wave
  is said to be **plane polarized** in the direction of vibration
- **Partial polarization** is when there is
  some restriction to direction of vibration but not 100%
