# Statistics and probability

## Sampling

- **Qualitative data:** described by words 
  - Example:
    - Q: "How are you feeling today?"
    - A: happy, sad, down, or excited
- **Quantitative data:** numbers and described information that can be counted
  - Example:
    - Q: "How many times do you eat everyday"
    - A: 1, 2, or 3
  - **Two types of quantitative data:**
    - **Continuous data:** describes quantities that are measured such as height, weight or age
    - **Discrete data:** describes quantities that are counted such as number of t-shirts owned
- Population and a sample
  - **Population:** consists of every member in the group that you want to find out about
  - **Sample:** a subset of the population that will give you information about the population as a whole
    - Choosing a sample:
      - **Target population:** the population from which you want to take a sample
      - **Sampling frame:** a list of the items or people from which you want to take a sample
      - **Sampling unit:** a single member from the sampling frame that is chosen to be sampled
      - **Sampling variable:** the variable under investigation
      - **Sampling values:** the possible values which the sampling variable can take
    - Sampling techniques
      - **Simple random sampling:** Each member of the population has an equal chance of being selected.
      - **Systematic sampling:** There is a list of the members of the population and a sample is selected every fixed interval at a random starting point.
      - **Stratified sampling:** Divides the population into non overlapping smaller groups known as *strata*. The strata are formed based on the members' shared characteristics. You then choose a random sample from each strata and put them together to form your sample
      - **Quota sampling:** similar to stratified sampling but involves taking a sample size from each strata in proportion to the size of the population
      - **Convenience sampling:** You select members of the population who are most easily accessible or readily available
    - **Bias in sampling:** Bias in a sample can be defined as concluding some incorrect statistical information
      - Some members of the population being excluded from the sampling frame
      - Non response. (If a survey is conducted by email, a portion of them might not respond and this sample is missing)
      - Bad design (questionnaire was unclear or ambiguous) 
      - Bias by the respondent (people often do not tell the truth in some questionnaires)
    - **Reliability of data:** Data is reliable if you can repeat the data collection process and obtain similar results
      - Data is sufficient if there is enough data available to support your conclusion
      - Missing data can cause unreliability of data
        - lack of responses to questionnaires or surveys
        - not all types of scenarios were data was recorded
      - Error in handling data

## Descriptive Statistics

- **Arithmetic mean:** the quotient of the sum of all data values and the number of data values in the population
  - $$ \overline x = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}}{n} $$ 
  - $$\mu = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}}{n} $$ (if it is dealing with the whole population)
- **Mode:** the value which occurs the most frequently in a set of data
- **Median:** the value in the middle position when data is arrange in order of size
- **Measures of dispersion:**
  - **Range:** $$x_{max} - x_{min}$$ (how spread out the data is / the dispersion)
  - **Quartiles:** values that divide your data into quarters
    - The first quartile (lower quartile) has 25% of the data below it
    - The second quartile is the median. 50% of the data lies below the median and 50% lies above it
    - The third quartile (upper quartile) has 75% of the data below it
